Static Initialization Block Challenge

Create a class named Calculator with two static integer variables: num1 and num2.

Challenge: Use a static initialization block to assign values to num1 and num2 before any Calculator object is created.

Test your code:

In your main method, directly print the values of num1 and num2 without creating a Calculator object.

Explanation:

Static initialization blocks are executed only once, when the class is loaded into memory. This ensures the values are assigned before any object usage.
